# Gin web documentation
Idea for [Gin web framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) documentation.

This website is made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
After installing `hugo` you can run in the root directory of this repo
```sh
hugo serve
```
and visit `localhost:1313`


# Contributing
In order to make this documentation happen here is a list of what should be done:
- [ ] Modify the home page
- [ ] Style the side menu
- [ ] Style the content
- [ ] Add a header
- [ ] Add a footer
- [ ] Use `hugo weight` to sort pages
- [ ] Add content, decide the main chapters (reference the gin-gonic/gin README.md)
- [ ] ...other

If you want to work on a feature (or even just a part of a feature) open a new issue first so other people won't work on the same thing
